#### Description:

The Personal Expense Tracker is a command-line based Python application designed to help users record, manage, and analyze their daily expenses. The main goal of this project is to provide a simple yet effective way to track personal spending while demonstrating core Python programming concepts such as file handling, modular function design, and automated testing.

The application allows users to add expenses by entering an expense name, category, and amount. Each expense is automatically saved with the current date. To ensure data persistence, the program stores expense records in a JSON file, which allows structured data storage and easy retrieval. Additionally, the same data is appended to a CSV file, making it convenient to open and analyze the expenses using spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

One of the key features of this project is the ability to calculate the total expenses from all recorded data. The program reads the stored JSON data and sums up the expense amounts, providing users with a clear overview of their total spending. Another important feature is the report generation system, which creates a text-based report showing category-wise expense totals. This helps users understand where most of their money is being spent.

The project is structured around multiple functions to maintain clean and readable code. The main function handles user interaction and menu navigation, while helper functions manage tasks such as adding expenses, loading stored data, calculating totals, and generating reports. At least three of these functions are tested using pytest to ensure correctness and reliability. Automated testing improves code quality and demonstrates good software development practices.

This project was developed as the final project for CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P). It reflects the use of concepts learned throughout the course, including conditionals, loops, file I/O, error handling, and unit testing. The simplicity of the interface combined with practical functionality makes this project both beginner-friendly and suitable for real-world use.

Overall, the Personal Expense Tracker serves as a practical tool for managing personal finances and a strong portfolio project that highlights problem-solving skills, Python proficiency, and software design fundamentals.
